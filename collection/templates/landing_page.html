					<div class="how-it-works-block">
						The basic premise of the Tree of Knowledge is that objects/agents should behave according to the same rules independent of what scenario they are in! 
						For example: people will stay the same people and act according to the same basic rules if they are shopping in a street market or conducting job interviews. <br><br>
					
						So, to model your system of interest, you only need to specify which objects are present in your system and what their initial state is. 
						The objects' behaviours come from a centralized repository of object behaviours. 
						If necessary, you may also add new behaviour rules to the repository. This might be especially relevant when modelling a new type of object or objects in a completely new environment.
						
						<!--
						The different behaviour of individuals is accounted for by choosing more specific objects from the hierachy of object (see figure 1) or by making the behaviour rules more specific by e.g. including the condition "IF culture=='occidental'". 
						(behind the scenes these two options have the same effect.)

					<div class="how-it-works-block">
						When users add new behaviour rules to objects, the question remains 'Which of the behaviours rules are actually true?'<br><br>
						Here is where the strength of the Tree of Knowledge truly comes to bear:<br>
						Over time users will have modelled different systems using the same objects. The system can therefore automatically test the objects' behaviours in all these different scenarios! 
						After all, if we say that some type of objects (e.g. people) have a certain behaviour, then this behaviour must be valid in all circumstances/scenarios. 
						By testing the behaviour rules this way we can get truly robust insights about our objects of interest. 
						Also, the insights will be more accurate than with existing methods, because they are learned from more data. 
						<br><br>
						The behaviour rules are optimized such that in as many simulations as possible the simulated values are as close as possible to the true, observed values. 
						Through the optimization a probability is learned for each behaviour rule - the probability that the rule is true (in all the different scenarios).

					<div class="how-it-works-block">
						The Rule Learning can also easily be used for hypothesis testing: You can formulate any relation, dependence or behaviour as a new rule and the system will learn the probability that it is true.
						Actually, due to the Bayesian inference and updating, the system doesn't only learn the probabilities that rules are true but also the exact confidence for these predictions (in form of pdfs - see figure 2).
						<br>
						Using simulations has the added advantage that behaviours/phenomena can be tested even if they were not directly observed or if they co-occur with other phenomena.

						internal state changes depending on inside and outside conditions (agent-based, monte-carlo simulation). To create a simulation model of a system you use these objects with their 
						pre-defined behaviours and, if necessary, add new behaviours to them.
						<br><br>
						To allow for learnings accross different models, the object types with their behaviour rules are sorted into a hierarchy of objects (figure 1).<br>

						Behaviour rules are also learned this way: for each simulation in which a certain object occurs, the system automatically checks which combination of the object's rules produce the most correct simulation. 
						Rules that improve the results of many different simulations are considered to be more correct than rules that worsen their results. <br>
						All this is done within the rigorous formalism of likelihood-free Bayesian inference => the learned probability distributions accurately reflect the certainty about the rules.

			A knowledge base is a database which stores data in an integrated fashion. As with existing knowledge bases (dbpedia, yago, etc.), any structured data can be uploaded to the Tree of Knowledge's knowledge base. 
			The Tree of Knowledge's knowledge base, however, goes much further: for any datapoint in the knowledge base we know everything: when it was observed, what attribute/relation of what specific object was being observed and much more.
			Furthermore, a high level of data quality is assured through strict data monitoring and data validation. <br>

			<br>
			The growth/refinement of object behaviours is even more significant!<br>
			As users make new models portraying the objects in new scenarios (the scenarios they are trying to understand/for which they have data), 
			the object's behaviour gets increasingly comprehensive and exact. If objects have been simulated and evaluated in sufficiently many environments, we expect that it will be possible to create the most accurate economic models with them!

			In other words: the uncertainty about behaviour rules (due to imperfect knowledge of the world) are always accurately determined through likelyhood-free bayesian inference and bayesian updating.<br>
			When making predictions these uncertainties are accurately propagated through the system through monte-carlo simulations.
